# No Internet Game
A fairly cheap ripoff of the classic chrome browser "no internet game"

## HOW TO PLAY
- click into the game screen and press any keyboard key to begin playing
- the idea is to make the player that looks like either a dinosaur or a playtpus jump over the cacti without hitting them for as long as you can
- points are based on how long the player survived (~20 points per second)
